### General Structure for Marking Schedule
1. **Mark Allocation**: Clearly outline how marks are distributed for each part of a question.
2. **Key Elements**: Identify key steps or solutions that need to be shown to earn full or partial marks.
3. **Partial Marks**: Define the allocation for partially correct answers (e.g., formula application, working shown, but wrong final answer).
4. **Clarity**: Highlight where steps, diagrams, or sketches are essential.

### Marking Schedule Plan for ENGR123 Test 2

#### Question 1: Continuous Random Variables [18 marks]
1. **Sketch of PDF (3 marks)**
   - 2 marks: Correct shape in the region $\(1 \leq x \leq 2\)$
   - 1 mark: Properly labeling axes.
  

Determine the shape of the PDF:
- **Linear**: If $\( f(x) \)$ is a first-degree polynomial (e.g., $\( f(x) = ax + b \)$).
- **Quadratic**: If $\( f(x) \)$ is a second-degree polynomial (e.g., $\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \)$).
- **Exponential**: If $\( f(x) \) contains \( e^{kx} \)$, indicating exponential growth or decay.
- **Piecewise**: If $\( f(x) \)$ has different expressions for different ranges of $\( x \)$.


Sketch the graph:

    Use the correct shape and indicate the domain 1≤x≤21≤x≤2.
    Plot key points, such as f(x)f(x) values at x=1x=1 and x=2x=2.

Label axes:

    Clearly label the xx-axis and f(x)f(x)-axis. Include units if specified.
